## Code of Conduct

We have adopted a Code of Conduct, that we expect all the participants of our project to adhere to. You can find the full text [here](https://github.com/fahad19/proppy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Open Development

Development of the project is done publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/fahad19/proppy). Core team members and also other external contributors send Pull Requests and they all go through the same review process.

## Bugs and Issues

Bugs can be reported as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fahad19/proppy/issues).

Before submitting any issue, please make sure they are not a duplicate of any other [existing issues](https://github.com/fahad19/proppy/issues).

## Proposals

For every new feature, package or a change, we post [proposals](https://github.com/fahad19/proppy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproposal) under GitHub Issues publicly.

Members from the project and other interested parties can then comment on the proposal, discussing about the strengths and weaknesses, and the proposal gets refined/updated based on feedback.

Once the spec is ready and finalized, the development begins.

In your Proposal description, make sure you answer these questions:

* What is the current situation?
* What is the proposed change?

## Sending a pull request

If you are looking for ways to contribute with code or documentation to the project directly, you can help us out by contributing to issues with [`help wanted`](https://github.com/fahad19/proppy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label on GitHub.

We already have automated checks for tests and linting for all Pull Requests, but you can always run these commands locally to make sure everything is working as expected:

```
$ npm install

$ npm run bootstrap
$ npm run lint
$ npm test
```

If your Pull Request results in a change in the API, then please update the [examples](https://github.com/fahad19/proppy/tree/master/examples) in the same repository accordingly, as well as the API documentation (`README.md` of every package).
